| ⚠️ **Attention**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| This project was done on FASM in <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Real_Mode">`real processor mode`</a> under `MS-DOS`. Since there was no page addressing before, the executable file of the program will not run on modern operating systems `Windows 8, 10, 11.` |

The executable file has the format `*.com` format and any com file executor under Windows is required to run it.
You can use `DOSBox`.

1. Install <a href="https://www.dosbox.com">`DOSBox`</a> on your computer. Use <a href="https://www.dosbox.com/download.php?main=1">this link</a>.
2. Install `*.com` file from release.

## Using

1. Place the `DOSBox` executable file and the `*.com` executable file in the same directory.
2. Left-click the `*.com` file and drag it onto the `DOSBox` executable.
3. Play!!!

## Code Refactoring

If you want to refactor the code, then you can use several possible tools. But to implement any of them, you need a FASM compiler.
1. Install FASM on your computer by <a href="https://flatassembler.net/download.php">this link</a>.
2. Copy `proc16.inc` on the following path `~\FASM\INCLUDE\MACRO`.
    - `proc16.inc` - macro file for fasm. This file includes the ability to create local parameters in routines and use calling conventions.
3. Open `FASMW.exe` and you can start coding.

But if you won't write code more comfortable you can use `FASM Editor 2.0`.
4. Install `FASM Editor 2.0` by <a href="https://fasmworld.ru/instrumenty/fasm-editor-2-0/">this link</a>.
5. Start `FEditor.exe`.
6. First of all go `Services\Settings`.
    - FASM: put way to `FASM.exe`;
    - INC: put way to `INCLUDE` folder;
    - DBG: put way to `*.exe` debugger.

### Debugger

You can use `Olly Dbg`. Install by <a href="https://www.ollydbg.de/">this link</a>.
